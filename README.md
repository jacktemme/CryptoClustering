# Module 20

This repository contains an analysis of cryptocurrency price changes that is analyzed through K-means clustering models, which is an unsupervised learning algorithim through the scikit library. The data was cleaned in two different ways before clustering and then the results were analyzed to determine what method led to the best plots to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24 hour or 7 day price changes. The first cleaning method of the data was just by scaling the data, while the second utilized scaling as well as Principal Component Analysis which brings down this multivariable data into less variables. Overall, the PCA approach lead to tigher clusters, which allowed for more apparent division in the cyrptocurrencies based off of these price changes. The anlaysis was performed in the Crypto_Clustering Jupyter notebook file.
